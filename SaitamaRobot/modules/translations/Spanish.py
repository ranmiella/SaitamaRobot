Markdown is an excellent formatting tool supported by telegram. {} has several improvements, to ensure that \
Saved messages are deciphered correctly, and to enable you to create a button.

- <code> _italic_ </code>: wrapping text with '_' will produce italic text
- <code> * bold * </code>: wrapping text with '*' will produce bold text
- <code> `code` </code>: wrapping text with '`' will produce monospaced text, also known as 'code'
- <code> [sometext] (someURL) </code>: this will create a link - the message will only show <code> text </code>, \
and tapping on it will open the page in <code> someURL </code>.
EXAMPLE: <code> [Button] (buttonurl: example.com) </code>

- <code> [buttontext] (buttonurl: someURL) </code>: this is a special enhancement to enable telegram users \
button in their markdown. <code> buttontext </code> will be what is displayed on the button, and <code> someurl </code> \
will be the url that is opened.
EXAMPLE: <code> [Button] (buttonurl: example.com) </code>

If you want multiple buttons on the same line, use: same, like:
<code> [one] (buttonurl: //example.com)
[two] (buttonurl: //google.com: same) </code>
This will make two buttons on one line, not one button per line.
